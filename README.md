# Histogram-Equalisation
Histogram equalisation is a technique used to enhance the contrast of image using the histogram of image. The histogram of image represents the frequency of gray levels in the image. The gray levels of image vary from 0 to 255, that is a gray scale image's pixel size is 8 bits(1 byte). So the histogram contains frequency of occurrence of values from 0 to 255.
